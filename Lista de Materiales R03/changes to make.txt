Things to correct:
- Allow for customization of name 
- Add thick lines and general customization of form
SHOULD I USE COMPLETE DESCRIPTION? - Check that elements that have been added, because theyre being deleted accidentally or something - no deleting, its just that they have the same key
DONE - Change delimiter
DONE - Make sure all sheets are closed after the execution has finished, and only the result is open 
DONE - Try and add filters to the columns
- Make sure that you cant add twice the same project with BoMList (same excel titles)
